TODO:
- Variable width curved line (x)
- Dot fill (x)
- Experiment with how to randomly generate structures/compositions of these shapes. Need a different approach than before. Maybe more incremental / tree like?
- Triangles - with fill types (x)
- Variable width or squigglyness to lines or shading?
- Circle, rect and triangle with thick border

How to do variable width curved line?
...

How to generate compositions of shapes?
- The simple approach is just uniform random sampling if positions to draw objects. 
- Create some more complex structures of several objects together in cool ways (like to long line with multiple short parallel)
- Generate a ton of different outputs and try to find something cool. 
- Can add variable path.
- Can also add some simple path/tree generation to create "lightning strikes" or similar.
- Need something that is easily tunable. To be able to e.g. do a Kandinsky style lines + circles study.
