# IDEAS:

- Play with attractors, chaotic differential equations in XY plane, also possibly nonlinear diff eqs that are time-varying. Lorenz is the natural place to start.
- Random walks with different constraints/weight functions on position, velocity, acceleration, jerk. Could for instance penalize deviation from some trajectory such as circle or more crazy orbits.
- Grids of objects. Can be as simple as polygons or circles with randomly sampled sizes. Or e.g. create a cactus creator algorithm that generates random cacti (or any other random fun object). Or even just some abstract shapes consisting of points, lines and boxes. Rocket generator would be awesome
- Flow fields. Should write general functionality for plotting FFs and then easily change out Perlin noise or nonlinear differential equations etc.
- Trigonometric parametric curves.
- Fun with hexagons. E.g. hexagon perspective pattern with fills?
- Download height map data and generate contour plots for fun geographical locations. Tilezen is one data source. Could try to generate the contour lines custom with Bezier curves and math, or maybe use matplotlib and export to svg. Maybe mpl first to see how it could look and possibly expand. Can retrieve the contour lines from mpl and do things with them if wanted. 
- Experiment with occult plugin to do 2D occlusion. 
- Experiment with shapely and occult to do 3D occlusion.
- Flow imager
- Truchet tiles (circles, knots, ...)
- 3D "potential fields" lines (think Currents artwork)

### TODO:
- generatize map code as an easy to use package
- fix maps being flipped?
