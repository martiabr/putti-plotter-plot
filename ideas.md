# IDEAS:

- Play with attractors, chaotic differential equations in XY plane, also possibly nonlinear diff eqs that are time-varying. Lorenz is the natural place to start.
- Random walks with different constraints/weight functions on position, velocity, acceleration, jerk. Could for instance penalize deviation from some trajectory such as circle or more crazy orbits.
- Grids of objects. Can be as simple as polygons or circles with randomly sampled sizes. Or e.g. create a cactus creator algorithm that generates random cacti (or any other random fun object). Or even just some abstract shapes consisting of points, lines and boxes.
- Flow fields. Should write general functionality for plotting FFs and then easily change out Perlin noise or nonlinear differential equations etc.
- Trigonometric parametric curves.
- Fun with hexagons. E.g. hexagon perspective pattern with fills?
